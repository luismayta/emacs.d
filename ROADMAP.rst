Roadmap
-------

This document is designed to be a living record of the current and
projected priorities for the Emacs project. It is, of course, always
subject to change and exists solely to give the community an idea of
where we're going. The roadmap is set by the Emacs core team. If you
have feature suggestions for Emacs, please submit a `GitHub
issue <https://github.com/luismayta/emacs.d/issues>`__ and, if of sufficient
size and approved by the team, it will be added here. If you have
concerns about the roadmap, you can e-mail the Emacs devs at
``slovacus@gmail.com`` or raise a GitHub issue. Note
that bugfixes and miscellaneous features are not considered "roadmap
projects", and will be addressed in the due course of normal Emacs
development. This page exists to outline large-scale future plans for
Emacs.
