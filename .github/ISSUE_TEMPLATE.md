## The problem

Briefly describe the issue you are experiencing (or the feature you want to see added to Emacs). Tell us what you were trying to do and what happened instead. Remember, this is _not_ a place to ask questions.

## Environment

* OS: {Please write here}
* Emacs version: {Please write here}
* Emacs.d version : {Please write here}

## Details

If necessary, describe the problem you have been experiencing in more detail.

## Link to Emacs logs

Create a [GIST](https://gist.github.com) which is a paste of your _full_ Emacs logs, and link them here. 
Do _NOT_ paste your full Emacs logs here, as it will make this issue very long and hard to read! 
If you are reporting a bug, _always_ include Emacs logs!
